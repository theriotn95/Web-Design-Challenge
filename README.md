# Web-Design-Challenge

*For this project I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past project specifically, I plotted weather data.

*In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which to navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. They also have a landing page, a page where a comparison of all of the plotsis available, and another page where the data used to build them is visable.

*In this project I made use of various bootsrap compnents and learned a great amount about HTML and CSS to create this dashbaord with analysis.
